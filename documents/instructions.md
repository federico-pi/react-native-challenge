# Coding challenge - React Native

### Introduction
For this challenge, we want you to build a simple React Native application to consume and show data from the TVMaze API
https://www.tvmaze.com/api.

### User story
As a user I would like to search for TV show names so I can know more about the details of the TV show like summary, when it will be aired (if it’s still running), the average rating and also see a picture of the TV show.

### Requirements and submission guidelines
● Build your solution in React Native;
● Use an online Git repository (BitBucket or GitHub) or send us a ZIP file which includes the local .git folder;
  ○ Code and commit messages should be treated as you would on a real-world task;
● Please take some time to think about code quality and testing, and demonstrate your approach to these aspects
  ○ Try to use TDD when developing your solution and provide “Unit Tests”;
● Provide a README.md with instructions on how to test the application. 

### Challenge assessment
● Clean code and general code structure;
● Code quality (testing and maintainability).
